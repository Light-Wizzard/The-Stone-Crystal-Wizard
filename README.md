# The Stone Crystal Wizard

The Stone Crystal Wizard is a technology that uses Crystals

This project is about building a Crystal Computer that can record sensor data, the name came from a dream I had, and finding a name for that dream led me here, where I will talk about my concept of a Crystal Computer, the Wizard is what guides you from one interaction to the next. 

In my dream, I found a Stone online and bought it, my wife was not too happy about the purchase, but I soon cracked it open, and found an ancient tablet in it, inside the tablet was a Crystal Computer, it recorded data about temperature, humidity, air pressure, earthquakes, magnetic strength, magnetic direction, and magnetic polarity, all things, you want to record to determine when the Earth will reverse its Polarity.

When Johannes Kepler was looking for the Birth date of Jesus Christ, he found Tycho Brahe, who showed him the Torah written in the 3rd Century, it said Christ was the name of the Binary Star we call Sirius, which aligns with the Great Pyramid on 25 December under the Julian calendar, and 14 January under the Gregorian calendar, and Sir Isaac Newton proved Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah, to make only the Love of Money Evil, when it states Money is the Root of All that is Evil, it is clear Evil is the backward spell for Live, and Newton was ["The Last Magician"](http://lightwizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/webforms.html#newton_video), and Nikola Tesla was the Last Wizard.

History calls Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, as the Greatest Wizards of all times, but they believed Jesus Bar Abbas was, he was the Leader of the Militia that defeated the Roman Empire, and he said the End of Time was coming in 2,060 years, they reset the calendar to one, and the countdown began.
You can ask NASA, they did a 100-year study and concluded it is decaying at a constant rate of around 5% a century, after 20 Centuries we are out of Time.

This project is to prove this Stone Crystal Wizard can be built, and I want to build it, so, we will see blueprints in the form of Blender 3D animation files, schematics, and detailed explanations on how to make these crystal devices.

I will create an Audiobook series called "The Stone Crystal Wizard", it will talk about all this, and what I am working on first, building things cost money, so I plan to sell these same mp3 files online, at Audiobook stores, so, I can afford to build this Stone Crystal Wizard.
