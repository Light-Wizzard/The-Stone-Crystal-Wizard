# The Stone Crystal Wizard

The Stone Crystal Wizard is a technology that uses Crystals

This project is about building a Crystal Computer that can record sensor data, the name came from a dream I had, and finding a name for that dream led me here, where I will talk about my concept of a Crystal Computer, the Wizard is what guides you from one interaction to the next,
it can be a series of switches you move right or left, or up or down. 

In my dream, I found a Stone online and bought it, my wife was not too happy about the purchase, but I soon cracked it open, and found an ancient tablet in it, inside the tablet was a Crystal Computer, it recorded data about temperature, humidity, air pressure, earthquakes, magnetic strength, magnetic direction, and magnetic polarity, all things, you want to record to determine when the Earth will reverse its Polarity.

When Johannes Kepler was looking for the Birth date of Jesus Christ, he found Tycho Brahe, who showed him the Torah written in the 3rd Century, it said Christ was the name of the Binary Star we call Sirius, which aligns with the Great Pyramid on 25 December under the Julian calendar, and 14 January under the Gregorian calendar, and Sir Isaac Newton proved Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah, to make only the Love of Money Evil, when it states Money is the Root of All that is Evil, it is clear Evil is the backward spell for Live, and Newton was ["The Last Magician"](http://lightwizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/webforms.html#newton_video), and Nikola Tesla was the Last Wizard.

History calls Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, as the Greatest Wizards of all times, but they believed Jesus Bar Abbas was, he was the Leader of the Militia that defeated the Roman Empire, and he said the End of Time was coming in 2,060 years, they reset the calendar to one, and the countdown began.

You can ask NASA, they did a 100-year study and concluded it is decaying at a constant rate of around 5% a century, after 20 Centuries we are out of Time.

One paper you might find of interest is Earthâ€™s magnetic field is probably not reversing [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1722110115](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1722110115), but the model I will use is the same one Kepler, Newton, or Tesla would have used, but I have to admit at this point, our North Magnetic Pole is heading towards the Equator, and if the current rate precist, it should get there by the year 2061, but I see no reason it cannot just go back to phyiscal South Pole location since a compass points North, its pole must be South.

I will try to prove that our Magnetosphere is about to do a pole reversal, but if you read the above, maybe it will do it in a different way, and the way I want to prove, is the that on 14 January 2061 at 6:32 PST, when the Binary Star Sirius aligns with the Great Pyramid, our decay rate will be at 0, and the count down is over, and our Atmosphere vents into space for <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> the diameter of the Earth, or 6.66 minuites, and our Gravity will be a 0 for that time, and slowly build back up, and instant ice age, and I want to build an [End of Time Machine](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/End-Of-Time-Recorder) to prove it.

This project is to prove this Stone Crystal Wizard can be built, and I want to build it, so, we will see blueprints in the form of Blender 3D animation files, schematics, and detailed explanations on how to make these crystal devices.

I will create an Audiobook series called "The Stone Crystal Wizard", it will talk about all this, and what I am working on first, building things cost money, so I plan to sell these same mp3 files online, at Audiobook stores, so, I can afford to build this Stone Crystal Wizard.

YouTube video on Unreal Engine and how it is used to [make movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAH17gNegzg), What I like about Unreal Engine is that it is free to use, if you sell your movie, you have to pay royalties after the first million.

You have to pay for most of the Plugins like Replica Studio, but it has a free version with one voice, and then you pay extra for the voices, like $5 each.

Cost-wise, this is the cheapest to get into, it is geared for people who make movies, so most of the cost is in royalties on that movie, so the cost upfront is minimal, and geared for people who do not make movies, like most people, so they still make money, but geared to movies like Star Wars, the Matrix, and other blockbuster movies.

I have been using Unreal for a long time, years, not sure how many but over a decade, I just like playing with it, learning about it, and the games I made were not meant for anyone to play, I was always looking for a way to make movies with it, and so were others, and now it is set up for making movies.

I have to install 4 and 5 because not all the plugins work with 5 yet, but I am only going to use 5, so I will have to wait for the plugs to migrate to 5, which is soon for the ones I want to use, I will show you how to [set up Unreal Engine](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Stone-Crystal-Wizard/wiki/Unreal-Engine).

I have to work in Windows due to the speech, but they do make Unreal for Linux.

Not sure what voice comes free with it yet, my guess is one male or female, maybe both, still waiting for it to load, and I have to learn how to use it, I am hoping it is an Americal Male voice that I can use, but I have to look at their licensing model for commercial, but if I can, I will write using only one voice for first chapter 1, so I can try to sell it, and get money to buy all the software I need to make chapter 2.

I need to find actors that can write their own scripts, meaning they can read my script, and add to it, so it flows like a movie, so what I want to do, is write the full script, with all the characters, whoever wants to take over a charter, only needs to rewrite their lines, without changing the meaning or my reply, so they paraphrase it, this gives me a script that does not sound like I wrote it, giving more dynamics to the movie.

If you want to be a character, or can find someone that does, let me know, all you have to do is read the script, edit your parts and send it back to me, in the credits, you will be that character, and I will try to find a voice like yours, or, the best part, we can clone your voice, we might still use stock voices for translations, not sure how that works, but I want this in English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, German, and a few more, but for the most part, besides training your voice, and paraphrasing your speech, you do not have to do anything else.

I have no idea what percentage to give everyone because I have no idea how many characters I need, but I want at least 3, and I need at least one male and one female beside myself.

The Script is only two pages long, I was going for an Audiobook, but a video is better, and timewise works better, I can make one long movie, instead of a lot of short chapters in an audiobook, making this much different to write.

The story will start off with me waking up out of a Nightmare, dreaming about a Stone Crystal Wizard that was carved into an ancient box full of technology that recorded the last End of Time, so chapter 1 is about me waking up and buying it online, just like in my dream, and me decoding it, and figuring out how it works, having to clean it up and replace some broken crystals that power it.

Chapter 2 is when everyone else comes in, if I have no volunteers to be a character, I will have to write all the parts, and how it sounds like someone else did, but it will also limit how many characters I use in the movie.

The movie is going to be done in parts, part 1 will be chapter 1, and so on, so each chapter is the video time, and I am thinking 45 minutes to 1 hour each chapter, so I will call the movies by chapter number, and make the audio and video files that long.

I can build the scene, add the actors, and animate their voices with AI characters and AI voices.

I will write the base dialog for all the characters, so I can write my parts, and all the others, so everyone can work on their part on this own, and I do not have to wait on anyone, so no pressure on anyone, we set a date that needs to be done, and then you send me your script, I will have to edit it so the AI will say it correctly, but I am not going to change what you wrote, nor get into how you edited it, this needs to flow like someone else said it, so what you write, is how it was said, so be serious when you edit it and keep with the main communication so it makes sense, make it natural, and keep with the intensity of a real-life sense.

I can set up the scene for the scripts I wrote, and adjust the timeline for the time you added or removed from what I wrote, so this flows, and I can go back and edit anything later.

We put all the scenes together, you can watch and listen to it, let me know if I need to adjust the script, by adding or removing pauses, or changing how a word is pronounced, so we get your dialog the way you want it.

If you have Windows or Mac, you can install all the software and use my license to get the plugs I have to purchase, and I can help you set it, so you can work directly with Audio or Video, should you want to learn how to make movies in Unreal Engine, or just learn how to tweak your own voice or character.

You can look at all the voices and characters at Replica Studio, and see which one you like to play your role, and you can pick what name you use for your character, so you do not have to play yourself as I am doing.

This movie is Science Fiction, but all science is based on Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, as well as myself, so this is about Trinary Science, Trinary Universes, and Trianry Sanctuary, and I have over 60 videos and many books on this subject, so you can find out all about it, so you know what the science is all about.

Trinary Science basics for this movie.

God is all Light without Darkness, this is from the Torah and every Bible ever written.

You can say Light without Darkness or God, the two mean the same thing, and are interchangeable.

Anyone that follows a Shepard is a Sheep.

Anyone that buys and sells Electricity knowing God is All Light without Darkness is Satan because it takes Electricity to make Light, thus proving Light is our Soul, and why Tesla said we are all Light Beings.

Newton calculated the End of Time based on the Torah written before the 4th century, proving Christ is a Star known as Sirius that aligns with the Great Pyramid every year on 25 December under the Julian Calender and 14 January under the Gregorian Calendar and said that Jesus Bar Abbas would come back as the Flesh one hundred years before the End of Time on 14 January 2061 under the Gregorian Calendar, at 6:32 PM PST, but you can change the Time Zone, but this is still the exact date and time that I was born, and I cannot change what history wrote, but I can prove I was the only Flesh born on that date and time, and why I am making this movie, and why no one else can play my part of the Flesh.

That is what this series of movies is about, the End of Time, according to Kepler, Newton, Tesla, and the Torah told by me in the Flesh.

Movies are hard to market, and I am not good at making money. I do not like dealing with the IRS, but in this case, I will have to, I need to set up a business license for the Light Wizzard, so I can take Donations, and sell my Videos.

It would be great to get a deal with Netflix or someone, but I have no idea how to do this, so my concept is just to put the first chapter on YouTube and try to promote it, and see how it does, and see where this takes me.

I can make money on Tube if and only if I can get over so many subscribers, I have around 666 now and need over 1,000, not sure of the exact number, but I can make money putting this on YouTube, but I am going to leave that up to someone that wants to make a lot of money, because I am not going to look farther than YouTube because I do not care about the money as much, sure I need it to make better videos, get better equipment, but I also do not like Money, so anyone interested in making money, needs to find out how to market this.

I installed the AMD drivers for my video card, this is not an Nvidia card, but it does look better than it did, the stock drivers sucked, but this does limit me, I cannot use Twinmotions for one, but for making this video, I will not use it, so I can use this now, and anyone else does not have to buy an Nvidia graphics card, they are over $100, and a good one cost over $200, and a $1,000 card is considered to be a starting point if you want to do this professionally.

I also need an SSD drive, running this from a hard drive is slow, but it still runs.

I can do this by myself, and will not ask anyone for help, if you are not interested, why do it, this is not a lot of work for anyone but me, editing a script is easy, and takes very little time, if you like what I have written, you have little to edit if it needs to be tweaked, you know how, which only requires email, nothing else, no apps to install, nothing, I send you a link to the script, you can copy it, and edit it, and email it to me, I will give more details on the site, I will use my own site or GitHub, those interested only need to click the link, and you will see one file for each chapter, each character has a section that starts with charters name, for example:

Narrator:
Flesh hands the box to an inspector (this would be the name of the inspector, and not the name inspector, which is a title)

Flesh:
Does this symbol look like a Wizard to you?

Inspector:
If you consider a Wizard a form of writing like hieroglyphs, or petroglyphs.

...
All you do is this, put a [ ] around the text, and rewrite it below.

Inspector:
[If you consider a Wizard a form of writing like hieroglyphs.]
If you consider a Wizard a form of writing like hieroglyphs or petroglyphs.

I can even spell check it and do not care about grammar, this is people talking, and they do not have built-in grammar checkers.

Everyone that has a character will get a percentage of the profit after taxes, and I need to file 1099 for all payments to make this a legal company that pays taxes, if you have an issue with the IRS, we can do it under the table, but have to list you as uncredited, or unpaid, not sure about the verbiage yet.

If someone has an IMDb account, they can add this Series to the Light Wizzard, and add all the Characters that you have permission to add, if someone does not want an IMDb account, that is fine, they will not show up as actors is all.

I want to set this up as a normal company called the "Light Wizzard", I need a business license and Tax ID, so I can set up a Gateway for payments.

I have to get with the IRS and ask them about all these details, so I do everything legal, and will have more details in the Wiki.

If you have any interest, submit a ticket, in the subject put what your intestest is, for example, if you want to be a character, put in I would like to be a character, and in details, explain what character, if you want to know about a specific aspect, just ask.
